    "Welcome to the first project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to load the Boston housing dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported."

The **features**, `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, and `'PTRATIO'`, give us quantitative information about each data point. The **target variable**, `'MEDV'`, will be the variable we seek to predict. These are stored in `features` and `prices`, respectively."

Any value between 0 and 1 indicates what percentage of the target variable, using this model, can be explained by the **features**. _A model can be given a negative R<sup>2</sup> as well, which indicates that the model is **arbitrarily worse** than one that always predicts the mean of the target variable._\n",

    "The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "### Question 5 - Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

    "\n",
    "> 2. At a max_depth=10, the model suffers from overfitting, which is high variance.  We know this because of the growing variance between the training score and the validation score where the tarining score is improving while the validation score is getting worse.  This tells us that the model is overfitting and does not generalize well to new data.  "

    "** Hint: ** Look at the graph above Question 5 and see where the validation scores lie for the various depths that have been assigned to the model. Does it get better with increased depth? At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model? And remember, Occams Razor states \"Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.\""

As given in the Hint (thank you!), when two models perform similarly, we should pick the more simple model.  In this case, the simpler model is the one with a max_depth=3. "

    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",

While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",

So two homes can be identical in terms of neighborhood and number of rooms, but the finishings will impact the sales price.  But ignoring that, I'm not convinced the model is performing well.  When comparing the predicted sale values to the statistics from the training dataset, this is what I conclude:\n",

    "> It makes sense that home #1 is below the mean price of \\$454,343 because it has 5 rooms instead of the mean of 6.24.  It has 17% low income workers instead of the mean of 12.9% (decrease in price) and a pupil-teacher ratio of 15 is less than the mean of 18.5 (increase in price).  Assuming the worse LSTAT and better PTRATIO cancel each other out, then we still have 1 less room then the mean and would expect a lower sales price.\n",

The minimum sales price in the dataset we used to train the model is \\$105k. I'm actually surprised the model predicted a sales price of $226k given how poorly this home's features are and how closely it seems to be to a home estimated at \\$105k.\n",

    "> For house #3, the number of rooms is near the max (8 vs 8.4), the LSTAT is near the min (3% vs 2%), and the PTRATIO is less than the min (12% vs 12.6%).  So I'd expect this home to be near the max sales price in the dataset, or near \\$1,024,800 vice the predicted sales price of 887,100.\n",

At this point in the process, I think home #1 is priced about right, home #2 is priced too high, and home #3 is priced too low.

    "- How relevant today is data that was collected from 1978? How important is inflation?\n",
    "- Are the features present in the data sufficient to describe a home? Do you think factors like quality of apppliances in the home, square feet of the plot area, presence of pool or not etc should factor in?\n",
    "- Is the model robust enough to make consistent predictions?\n",
    "- Would data collected in an urban city like Boston be applicable in a rural city?\n",

    "> Definitely not!  No no no I would not deploy this model.  The range in prices predicted for the same feature set gives credibility to my initial thoughts as described in Q10.  This model is not good. It is not robust to new data. And from the above range, it is certainly not consistent in its price predictions! \n",
    "\n",
    "> Inflation is important to consider.  The initial information said the MEDV values were scaled based on inflation.  But this ignores how home prices have adjusted since 1978.  And certainly the finishings of a house impact its sales price, as well as location location location.  Lots of development has happened since 1978 and the proximity to certain areas will either increase or decrease the value of a home. There are not enough features in the dataset to accurately represent the value of a home.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Location definitely matters, and as such, value and price appreciation is certainly different for cities versus urban areas.  It is also different per city. Values in downtown Detroit have moved differently than the values in downtown DC.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> In terms of whether it is fair to judge the price of a home based on the characteristics of an entire neightborhood, I say it is both fair and not fair.  I just depends.  Typically the homes in the same neighborhood are similar in size, configuration and finishings.  But this is not always the case.  My brother's home is in an older neighborhood where the homes were built in the 1970's.  Homes that have been updated are considerably more than homes that have not been updated.  Additionally, there are areas where gentrification is occuring and the gap between home values is dramatic. "
